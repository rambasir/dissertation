# Cyberbullying Detection Using Hybrid NLP Techniques
This repository contains a robust solution to identify and analyze cyberbullying behaviors using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The project combines FastText and BERT embeddings, autoencoders for dimensionality reduction, and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for fine-tuned feature extraction and classification.

## Key Features
 - Data Preprocessing

Handles noisy data, expands contractions, and tokenizes text.
Extracts emoji presence and cleans data for NLP tasks.
 - Hybrid Word Embeddings

Integrates FastText and BERT embeddings for rich semantic representation.

 - Dimensionality Reduction
Employs an autoencoder neural network to reduce embedding dimensions to 32.

 - Visualization
Uses t-SNE for high-dimensional data visualization.

 - Classification Model
Combines Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with ExtraTrees Classifier for final predictions.

## Accessibility


`Can be directly used on google colab`



## Results



The model demonstrates strong performance in cyberbullying detection, achieving:

`Accuracy: >90%,
F1-Score: ~0.88,
ROC-AUC: ~0.93`
